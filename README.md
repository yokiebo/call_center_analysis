# call_center_analysis

Dataset: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv
Tableau Visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edgar.orong/viz/Callcenter_16871849236670/Overview


**These are the steps I took to complete the project:**
1. Utilized a dataset sourced from data.world that replicates authentic data from a call center operation spanning a period of one month
2. Performed exploratory data analysis using SQL to examine the dataset, scrutinize and explore its contents, extract key insights, identify relationships, and summarize its main characteristics.
3. Developed a Tableau visualization to acquire insights into various factors such as the most active call centers, peak days of the week, overall sentiment trends, and more. This visualization serves as a valuable tool to help guide decision-makers in making informed business decisions.
